# Conversion

Scripts for converting Sony FX30, FX3, A7IV video files for use in Davinci Resolve.


Conversion for 4k 10bit 422 MP4 to Apple ProRes 10bit 422.

These scripts require **ffmpg**.

## Usage

Copy *422.bat** into the same directory as your imported media.

Run the script. 

Conversion will take some time -- the converted media will be placed the CONVERTED folder and is ready for import into Davinci Resolve.
